### Hi👋, I'm Kevin Jeremia Pontoh
I'm currently in my third year of Physics bachelor's degree. I fell in love with programming when I built my first ever "software product", called "bible-obsscript". Even though it's a small-sized project, it's never ceased to fascinates me because it solves real world problem, and until now it's still being used by my local church's multimedia team. Since then, I have realized that I possess a superpower within me—I can build a software product from zero-to-one that would solve real-world problems. That's why I decided to delve deeper into computer science and software engineering!

• 💻 I'm currently enrolled in Mobile (Android) Development Path at Bangkit Academy 2024 Batch-1
• 👽 I'm learning Android development, Data structures, and Algorithms at the momment
• 👐 i'm looking for internship opportunity. If you're hiring, let's chat! Email: <kevin.jeremia.pontoh@gmail.com> or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinj-pontoh/)
