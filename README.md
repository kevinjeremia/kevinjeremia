### Hi👋, I'm Kevin Jeremia Pontoh
🧑‍🔬 I’m a fourth-year Physics student who fell in love with programming after building my first software project, bible-obsscript—a small but meaningful tool still used by my church’s multimedia team today. That experience made me realize I enjoy building real-world solutions from scratch, and it sparked my passion for software engineering.

💡 Since then, I’ve been diving deeper into software development while also expanding my curiosity into materials science, particularly nanoplasmonics. I'm currently a research assistant at the Nanoplasmonics Technology Research Group @ BRIN Photonics Research Center, where I explore the intersection of physics and chemistry.

⚙️ I enjoy working across disciplines, picking up new tools quickly, and creating things that have real impact.

👐 Currently, I'm looking for internship opportunity. If you're hiring, let's chat! Email: <kevin.jeremia.pontoh@gmail.com> or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinj-pontoh/)
